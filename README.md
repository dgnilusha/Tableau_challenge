Citi Bike Trip Data Analysis
In this project, we will explore and analyze the Citi Bike trip history logs to discover unexpected phenomena and provide valuable insights for city officials and administrators. We will answer various questions, create visualizations, and design dashboards to present our findings. The focus of this analysis is to provide a clear and insightful overview that can drive programmatic changes and decision-making for the Citi Bike program.

Instructions
Data Source
We are using the Citi Bike trip history logs dataset to conduct our analysis. The dataset contains information about trip duration, start and stop times, station information, user details, and more. Our goal is to extract meaningful insights from this data.

Objectives
Discover Unexpected Phenomena: Identify and investigate two unexpected phenomena within the Citi Bike trip data.

Visualizations and Dashboards: Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). Create dashboards to present these visualizations and insights coherently.

Analysis and Insights: Accompany each visualization with an analysis explaining the phenomena and why they might be occurring. Your analysis should be concise, easy to understand, and tailored to a non-technical audience.

Create Maps: Create static or dynamic maps showing popular bike stations for starting and ending journeys

Tableau Story: Assemble Ourr visualizations, maps, and dashboards into a Tableau story. 

Assessment Criteria
Our final analysis will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Project Outline
Data Exploration: Understand the dataset's structure and content. Identify potential areas of interest.

Phenomenon Identification: Choose unexpected phenomena to investigate in the Citi Bike trip data.

Visualizations: Create insightful visualizations for each phenomenon. Consider trends, patterns, and comparisons.

Dashboards: Design dashboards to bring together visualizations and insights.

Map Creation: Generate static or dynamic maps showing popular bike stations with zip code data overlaid.

Tableau Story: Organizer visualizations, maps, dashboards, and analyses into a Tableau story.
